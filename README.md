# Mars Rover Coding Exercise

Required dependancies are:

JDK 1.7
<br />
Maven 3.2.3

To build this project and run the tests, I used these commands on OSX

export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_51.jdk/Contents/Home/
<br />
mvn clean install
<br />


To run the program I used these commands. The final argument is the relative path to a Rover Commands File:

chmod 0777 target/Euromoney/bin/Euromoney
<br />
./target/Euromoney/bin/Euromoney
